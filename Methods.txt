We intend on utilizing two sets of data in conjunction. StockValues will help us keep track of a stock's history
and look for any trends (A seasonal stock like a chistmas decoration company may rise and fall yearly), and
StockSentiment will allow us to glean positive and negative opinions on stocks by filtering keywords from 
tweets and websites. By combining the two we will create an algorithm that should be able to predict if a stock
is about to increase or decrease in value.
